# Me2Me

Me2Me is a command-line interface (CLI) program written in Go. It's a non-intelligent self-help assistant program designed to provide humorous and sarcastic responses to queries about bad habits. The program currently accepts arguments related to various bad habits such as smoking, drinking, gaming, procrastination, eating disorders, skipping meals, overspending, excessive phone usage, negative thinking, and being a night owl.

## Inspiration

Me2Me was inspired by the author's personal struggle with maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The author realized that sometimes, a little humor and sarcasm can go a long way in motivating people to break their bad habits. So, Me2Me was born - a tool to help users laugh at themselves and take the first step towards change.

## Installation

To install Me2Me, clone the repository and build the binary:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/me2me.git
cd me2me
go build
```

This will create a `me2me` executable in your current directory. To use Me2Me as a regular command, move the `me2me` executable to `/usr/bin`:

```bash
sudo mv me2me /usr/bin
```

Now you can run Me2Me from anywhere:

```bash
me2me weed?
```

## Usage

To use Me2Me, run the `me2me` command followed by a bad habit as an argument:

```bash
me2me weed?
```

The program will respond with a random, humorous, and/or sarcastic response. For example:

```bash
weed? Sure, let me just grab my death wish and join you.
```

Please note that Me2Me only accepts one argument at a time.
